# MetalXR | SteamVR*/OpenXR on MacOS!

### MetalXR is a full-scale implementation of OpenComposite and OpenXR on MacOS including support for launching SteamVR applications by utilizing layering such as Box64 (For M1).

## How does it work?
Pretty much how we explained in the description above! MORE IN DEPTH INFO COMING SOON!

## How can I install it?
You can download the latest disk image from our [Releases](https://github.com/PeaPodDevs/MetalXR) page.

## What are the requirements?  
As of now, we only support standalone* Android headsets (Meta Quest, Pico Neo, etc) because of limitations with macOS USB and DisplayPort handling.Feel 

As a minimum, you'll want:
- A machine running **macOS Ventura 13.0 or later**
- A graphics card capable of the full **Metal 2 API**.
- 8GB of system memory
- 256GB of storage
- A standalone VR headset
  - Our tests will be conducted with the Meta Quest 2 and Pico 4
  - PCVR-only headset support is being researched
  - Free to create a PR if you have added support for PCVR-only or a new headset!

We recommend:
- A machine running the latest macOS release
- A **dedicated** graphics card capable of the full **Metal 3 API**
- 4GB of video memory
- 16GB of system memory
- 256GB of SSD storage
- A standalone VR headset

If you don't know whether or not your GPU supports Metal 2 or Metal 3, [you can check here.](https://crystall1ne.dev/2023/05/03/metal-1-2-or-3/)
