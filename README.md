# MetalXR | SteamVR*/OpenXR on MacOS!

### MetalXR is a full-scale implementation of OpenComposite and OpenXR on MacOS including support for launching SteamVR applications by utilizing layering such as Box64.

## How does it work?
Pretty much how we explained in the description above! MORE IN DEPTH INFO COMING SOON!

## How can I install it?
You can download the latest DMG from our releases page which can be installed just like any other DMG/MacOS application.

## What are the requirements?
As of now, we only support standalone* Android headsets (Meta Quest, Pico Neo, etc) because of limitations with MacOS USB and DisplayPort handling. Feel free to create a PR if you have a way around this or have added support for a specific headset!

You will also need to have a Mac with **dedicated graphics** (unless on M1*) that support **Metal 2 or above**, without **both** of these you will either run like a potato or not at all. This is usaully only going to be Mac's from 2018 or later however utilizing upgrades to older Mac's (like an eGPU) should get you over the bar.

**We recommend Mac's with at least:**
* 16GB of RAM
* 4GB of VRAM
* An Intel Core i7-6660U*
* and 256GB of **SSD** Storage
